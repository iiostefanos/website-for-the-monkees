               THE MONKEES WEBSITE PROJECT by Stefan Sarbu
    ------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This Project (The Monkees website) is a build of a frontend-only website using the technologies that I have learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development. 

I have used Bootstrap 4 after using a wireframe designed here: https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/M163bf022f0f6c816fac7df1bba868ff41553866205430

Initially I got inspired by the BSB website. I have tried to use the images, logo, audio and video provided within the GitHub repo. I tried to keep it a clean and simple responsive website. 

The Monkees website includes 5 pages: Home, Events, Media, History and Contact
In the footer's section there are social media links to their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Spotify pages. If the Logo from the footer is clicked the visitor of the page will be directed to the top of the page.
If the logo from the navigation menu is clicked then you'll be redirected to the Home page.

On the Home page there's a slider with a few photos of the band, followed by 4 songs in audio format and a call to Action Image and Heading that invites the fans to listen for free these 4 tracks.

On the Events page the Fans can check the upcoming events for the next 3 months plus 3 clickable buttons: More Info, Tickets and VIP only.

On the Media pages there are 3 sections: Audio (with a playlist from Spotify), Video (an embedded video and the video from the daydream Believer song) and Gallery with a few images of the band members and album covers.

On the History page there is a short introduction history about the band followed by 3 cards with the options of discovering more about the band from 3 other websites, after the visitor chooses and clicks one of the buttons of each section.
Here I have used wikipedia, the Monkees website and another website made by their fans.

The fifth page og the website (Contact) is a simple contact form page that after clicking the send button we'll reply a confirmation message.

Other materials used in the website include:
